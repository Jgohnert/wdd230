        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p>JCPenney Portraits</p>

        <p>
          The JCPenney Portraits website is a good example of repetition because
          it keeps its brand colors of red and white on the page. The red stands
          out well on the white layout, and it also highlights the important
          parts of the webpage. Everything that is red on the page is either
          important information, such as sales and offers, or a link that the
          users can click on to navigated where they want to go. Using red
          consistently in this way helps users know what to expect when
          navigating this site, while also sticking to the main color of their
          brand to give the page a familiar feel for those who enjoy shopping at
          JCPenney.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>BUBBL'R</p>
        <a href="https://www.drinkbubblr.com/flavrs/" target="_blank">drinkbubbl'r.com</a>
        <img class="webimage" src="images/bubblr-webpage.jpg" alt="Image of the BUBBL'R website">
        <p>
          The design for the BUBBL’R website, specifically the section that
          advertises energy drinks, has a very simple design, which is a great
          choice because most of the art and styling of the page comes from the
          colorful cans displayed throughout the page. The result of having a
          minimal design that utilizes white space to separate the many
          different colors and flavors of their cans puts the drinks at the
          center of what they’re advertising. It is also good practice to list
          things out using the rule of thirds, which this page utilizes to
          evenly separate the cans on a grid for easy viewing. Even the fun
          styling of the text matches the colorful aesthetic of the website,
          which is unique and can grab the attention of most users visiting the
          site.

        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>NASA</p>
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">nasa.gov</a>
        <img class="webimage" src="images/nasa-webpage.jpg" alt="Image of the NASA website">
        <p>
          Following the visual hierarchy is very important when trying to
          capture user attention. The NASA website follows this principle very
          well. The top of the front page starts with all the most important
          news that NASA is excited to showcase first, such as recent missions
          and current studies being conducted to further our understanding of
          earth and space. Below is the list of people who are working on each
          project. This is so users can get a better understanding of who’s
          involved. Next are featured news articles that may also intrigue users
          that visit the website. Then scrolling down to the bottom of the page
          shows other topics and information of interest for those who are
          looking for anything specific. Having a news layout like this for a
          company that is constantly working on new projects is a great way to
          keep users focused on the most recent events while also providing
          information about previous topics and past discoveries of their
          interests.
